      <div class="w-100 w-50-ns pr2">
        <p>In computing, NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or
          unrepresentable value (Wikipedia). In many ways, data is meant to represent often unrepresentable features
          about the spaces, places, and people around us. This presents us with a problem - how are the fundamentally
          unquantifiable things, the things that should otherwise return a computational error statement - the NaN -
          actually being assigned numerical values that affect life in the city?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="w-100 w-50-ns">
        <p>Our theme this year is “Not a Number”
          to speak to the ways in which space and place are being transformed and shaped by the numbers that are meant
          to represent complexity in the everyday. We ask our artists to reflect on the stories within our city’s open
          data that speak to the undefined or unrepresentable value of the things that the data may be hiding.</p>

        <p>This year's Data Through Design Theme, NaN - Not a Number - invites artists and creators to help tell the untold stories of NYC's open data. How might data illuminate as much as complicate our understanding of the social, cultural, and environmental processes that NYC's open data speak to? Below you'll find some projects that seek to create new discussions about the ways that data reflects or misrepresents the people and places around us. NOTE: We hope this list is inspiring!</p>

We can not detect fine dust with the naked eye. Although electronic sensors provide accurate measurement data, the numbers and units of measurement remain abstract for us. Dietmar Offenhuber’s “dust mark” makes the particulate matter pollution in Stuttgart visible and tangible, using the technique of reverse graffiti.</li>

We mapped the experience of eight of them.</li>
            <li><a class="link underline black" href="http://pmcruz.com/dendrochronology/">Simulated Dendrochronology of U.S. immigration</a>: The United States can be envisioned as a tree, with shapes and growing patterns influenced by immigration.

        <p>A general rule of thumb of working with data is that 80% of your time will be spent preparing your data to be used for analysis/visualization/materialization. Data preparation -- cleaning, munging, reformating, parsing, filtering, etc -- can be a real "can of worms", which is to say, that it can be tricky even for experts. Below you'll find some handy links and references that might help you along your data handling, analysis, and visualization journies:</p>
