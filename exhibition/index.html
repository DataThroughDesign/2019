        <p>In computing, NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or
          unrepresentable value (Wikipedia). In many ways, data is meant to represent often unrepresentable features
          about the spaces, places, and people around us. This presents us with a problem - how are the fundamentally
          unquantifiable things, the things that should otherwise return a computational error statement - the NaN -
          actually being assigned numerical values that affect life in the city?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="w-100 w-50-ns">
        <p>Our theme this year is “Not a Number”
          to speak to the ways in which space and place are being transformed and shaped by the numbers that are meant
          to represent complexity in the everyday. We ask our artists to reflect on the stories within our city’s open
          data that speak to the undefined or unrepresentable value of the things that the data may be hiding.</p>
